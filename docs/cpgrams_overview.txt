Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) is the official platform of the Government of India for registering and monitoring public grievances.
It connects citizens to Ministries, States and Departments for service delivery and grievance redress.
Each complaint is given a unique registration number.
CPGRAMS mandates acknowledgement, tracking, forwarding to concerned departments, and resolution within specified timelines set by government policies.
If a complaint is not resolved satisfactorily, citizens may file an appeal.
CPGRAMS also provides escalation pathways and review mechanisms.
