One of the most transformative recent developments in Indian public transportation policy is the **PM e-Bus Sewa scheme**, launched by the Union Cabinet in August 2023 and significantly enhanced through the **PM e-Bus Sewa-Payment Security Mechanism (PSM) Scheme** notified by the Ministry of Heavy Industries on October 28, 2024. The enhanced scheme has an allocated budget of Rs. 3,435.33 crore and will support deployment of more than 38,000 electric buses in the country, with the objective of providing payment security in case of default by Public Transport Authorities for making timely payment to selected bidders/operators/OEMs on their monthly payment obligations for operations of electric buses. The original PM e-Bus Sewa scheme aimed to introduce 10,000 electric buses in city bus services across India and enhance urban infrastructure for green mobility, but the recent policy enhancement demonstrates the government's commitment to scaling up electric public transportation infrastructure while addressing the critical challenge of payment security that had previously deterred private sector participation in public transport operations.

This comprehensive policy framework represents a paradigm shift in India's approach to urban mobility, addressing both environmental sustainability and urban transportation challenges through innovative public-private partnership models. The World Resources Institute India supported India's Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs in developing the PM e-Bus Sewa Scheme, which will bring 10,000 electric buses to underserved cities around the country, highlighting the evidence-based policy development approach. The scheme's implementation is already showing tangible results, with major contracts being awarded, including GreenCell Mobility securing 1,200 electric bus orders across Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh cities, and specific allocations such as Indore receiving 150 air-conditioned electric buses as part of the scheme, representing the highest allocation. The policy's significance extends beyond mere vehicle replacement to encompass comprehensive urban transportation transformation, supported by India's broader transportation infrastructure development where the government allocated 26 billion U.S. dollars for metro expansion and pledged to spend 1.5 trillion dollars on general infrastructure, including public bus networks between 2020 and 2025. This massive investment reflects the government's recognition that sustainable urban mobility requires integrated policy approaches combining electric vehicle adoption, payment security mechanisms for operators, and substantial infrastructure development to support India's rapidly urbanizing population, which is expected to grow from 282 million in 2011 to 590 million by 2031, necessitating revolutionary changes in public transportation systems.
