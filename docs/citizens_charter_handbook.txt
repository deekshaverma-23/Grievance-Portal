A Citizen’s Charter is a public declaration of service standards, grievance mechanisms, and delivery timelines by government bodies.
Under DARPG (Department of Administrative Reforms & Public Grievances), Citizen’s Charters are issued for each Ministry/Department.
They outline:
- Services provided
- Expected timeline
- Who is responsible
- Grievance redress mechanism
- Escalation steps if service standards are not met
Departments are required to publish Citizen’s Charters and monitor compliance.
