In Rajasthan, the state cabinet has approved vital amendments to the Sewerage and Wastewater Policy of 2016. This updated resolution mandates a comprehensive sewerage network connecting every household, aligning with the Swachh Bharat Mission’s goals. It emphasizes that only rainwater should be visible in drains and introduces modern elements such as treated water reuse, production of organic manure and biogas, and alignment with circular economy principles. To ensure effective implementation, the policy incorporates the Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM)—previously used in major initiatives like Namami Gange—which combines government oversight with private-sector participation to deliver sewer infrastructure efficiently and sustainably.

Meanwhile, in Gurgaon (Haryana), the Municipal Corporation (MCG) has issued a formal administrative resolution requiring all sanitation complaints—submitted via the GMDA portal, grievance camps, public interactions, or social media—to be resolved within three days. Commissioned by MCG’s Chief Commissioner, Pradeep Dahiya, the resolution also mandates sanitation workers be provided with protective gear (jackets, gloves, masks) immediately. The directive includes a city-wide “pothole-free road” campaign and the repair of sewer manholes and drainage covers from September 1–15. Failure to comply could trigger disciplinary action, demonstrating a strong commitment to accountability and timely public service delivery
