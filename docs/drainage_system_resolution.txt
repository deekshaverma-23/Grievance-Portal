Here’s a detailed overview of recent solutions implemented across India to tackle drainage and sewage system issues, highlighting diverse approaches from policy reforms to technological and infrastructural measures:

Over in Rajasthan, the State Cabinet has revised its Sewerage and Wastewater Policy of 2016, aiming to reduce environmental pollution and protect public health. The amendments emphasize integrating modern technology—such as reuse of treated water, organic manure, and biogas production—within a circular economy framework. The updated policy also introduces the Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM)—previously used in Namami Gange projects—to fund and implement a comprehensive sewer network connecting every household in urban areas, ensuring that only rainwater flows openly in drains

Meanwhile, in Karnataka, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ordered an end to the discharge of untreated sewage into the Thenpennai River. The Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) has been instructed to deploy interim measures immediately, while long-term solutions—such as constructing 12 new sewage treatment plants (STPs) by 2025–2027 (in addition to the 26 already operational)—are underway. An 800 km drainage system has also been put in place, and both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu must update the NGT on progress by mid-November

In Lucknow, Divisional Commissioner Roshan Jacob has ordered extensive measures to tackle waterlogging and associated health risks. Authorities initiated urgent repairs to pothole-ridden roads, banned open dumping, and intensified drain cleaning. Enhanced street sweeping, daily garbage management, and the use of bleaching powder during drain cleaning—alongside fogging and anti-larval spraying—aim to curb mosquito-borne diseases. Seven projects under the CM Grid scheme (Phase 1) are on track for completion by January 2026, with more approved in Phases 2 and 3

Another critical repair in Lucknow involves a massive sinkhole on Kapoorthala Road, caused by a leaking sewage line. Suez India Pvt Ltd conducted the repair by jacketting a 6-meter pipe and diverting sewage using pumps and ROKA support. Heavy machinery facilitated dewatering, and once filled with sand, the Public Works Department (PWD) will finalize the road surfacing—restoring access to approximately 10,000 vehicles

Over in Ahmedabad, the ₹93 crore Eastern Trunk Line project has been completed. This massive trunk sewer line resolves issues of drains backing up and sewage overflow in areas like Gopal Chowk, Nikol, Kathwada, Odhav, and Vastral—benefiting nearly 500,000 residents. Complementary stormwater drainage improvements near Madhumalati Apartments are still pending

In Andhra Pradesh, an innovative “magic drains” pilot has rolled out in rural areas to simultaneously improve sanitation and recharge groundwater. These layered trench drains—made of rocks, gravel, sand, and pebbles—are cost-effective (approximately ₹1 lakh per 100 meters vs. ₹4 lakh for traditional cement drains) and built using local labour. Components like culverts and overflow pits support monsoon runoff. If successful, the scheme may be scaled up state-wide

Lastly, across Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, several Namami Gange Mission 2.0 projects have been completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2024–25. With an investment of ₹920 crores, these projects added 145 MLD of sewage treatment capacity, improved sewer networks, and installed intercepting systems to prevent untreated wastewater from entering the Ganga—aligning with NGT discharge standards. The Munger (Bihar) initiative, alone, includes an expanded STP and sewer network
