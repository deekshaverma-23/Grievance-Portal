Road Maintenance Complaint Resolution Case Study: Pothole Damage on NH-48, Gurgaon
Initial Complaint (Filed: August 5, 2024)
Mr. Vikram Singh, a daily commuter and resident of Sector 56, Gurgaon, filed a complaint through the NHAI's online grievance portal (Complaint ID: NHAI-2024-NH48-5621) regarding severe pothole damage on a 2-kilometer stretch of NH-48 between Udyog Vihar and Cyber City. The complaint detailed that multiple deep potholes had developed due to recent monsoon rains, causing vehicle damage, traffic congestion, and safety hazards. Mr. Singh reported that his car's suspension system was damaged after hitting a particularly deep pothole, and he had witnessed three other vehicles suffer similar damage in the past week. The complaint included photographic evidence showing potholes up to 8 inches deep and 3 feet wide, along with video footage demonstrating the traffic bottleneck caused during peak hours.
Emergency Response and Assessment (August 6-7, 2024)
Within 24 hours of receiving the complaint, NHAI's Regional Officer Gurpreet Kaur dispatched an emergency assessment team led by Executive Engineer Raj Kumar Sharma to the site. The team discovered that the affected stretch, originally constructed in 2019, had developed 47 significant potholes due to inadequate drainage during the heavy monsoon season and increased heavy vehicle traffic from nearby industrial areas. The technical assessment revealed that the existing bituminous layer had weakened due to water seepage through construction joints, while the base course remained structurally sound. The team also identified that blocked storm water drains on both sides of the carriageway had exacerbated the water logging problem, leading to accelerated pavement deterioration.
Immediate Safety Measures and Repair Implementation (August 8-12, 2024)
NHAI immediately deployed traffic management measures including LED warning signs, reflective barricades, and deployed traffic marshals during peak hours to guide vehicles around the damaged sections. The maintenance contractor, M/s Highway Maintenance Solutions Pvt. Ltd., was mobilized under the existing Performance-Based Maintenance Contract (PBMC) to begin immediate repairs. The repair work involved cutting out damaged pavement sections, applying tack coat, and filling with hot mix asphalt using mechanized equipment. Simultaneously, the drainage team cleared all storm water drains and installed additional catch basins to prevent future water accumulation. The entire 2-kilometer stretch was resurfaced with a 50mm thick Bituminous Concrete layer, and thermoplastic road markings were applied to improve visibility and lane discipline.
Quality Assurance and Completion (August 13-15, 2024)
Upon completion of the repair work, NHAI's Quality Control team conducted comprehensive testing including core density tests, Marshall stability tests, and ride quality assessments using laser profilometer equipment. All test results met Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) specifications, with the pavement achieving a roughness index of 2.1 m/km (well below the maximum permissible limit of 3.5 m/km). The repaired stretch was opened to traffic on August 15, 2024, with a speed restriction of 60 kmph for the first 48 hours to allow proper curing. Mr. Singh received a personal call from Assistant General Manager Priya Sharma on August 16, confirming the completion and quality of repairs.
Follow-up and Long-term Prevention (August 16-30, 2024)
NHAI implemented several preventive measures following this incident: installation of automated water level sensors in drainage systems, quarterly pavement condition surveys using high-resolution cameras, and establishment of a rapid response protocol requiring pothole repairs within 48 hours of reporting. The stretch was placed under enhanced monitoring for six months, with weekly inspections during monsoon season. Additionally, NHAI upgraded the existing PBMC contract to include performance penalties for delayed response and quality incentives for proactive maintenance. The complaint was officially closed on August 30, 2024, with Mr. Singh expressing complete satisfaction through the feedback portal, rating the resolution process 5/5 stars.
Long-term Impact and Systemic Improvements:
This successful resolution led to policy enhancements across NHAI's maintenance framework: implementation of predictive maintenance using AI-based pavement condition analysis, establishment of 24/7 citizen complaint response centers across all major corridors, and integration of real-time weather data with maintenance scheduling. NHAI also launched a mobile app allowing citizens to report road defects with GPS coordinates and photo uploads, ensuring faster identification and resolution of maintenance issues. The case became a model for efficient grievance redressal under India's Performance-Based Maintenance Contract system, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining citizen engagement, rapid response protocols, and quality-focused contractor accountability in modern highway maintenance.
