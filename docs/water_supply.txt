Based on the recent comprehensive policy updates from the Indian government, one of the most significant recent developments in water supply policy is the continued expansion and evolution of the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), launched in 2019, which represents India's most ambitious rural water supply transformation. The year 2024 marked critical progress in this mission, which aims to provide functional household tap connections to every rural household by the end of 2024, fundamentally changing how India approaches water security with the motto "Har Ghar Nal Se Jal" (water from tap to every home) JJM Dashboard. The mission has evolved beyond simple water delivery to encompass comprehensive water management, requiring 55 litres per capita per day of assured water supply while simultaneously implementing mandatory source sustainability measures such as rainwater harvesting, groundwater recharge, and grey water management JJM Dashboard. This policy represents a paradigm shift from the traditional approach of merely providing water access to creating a holistic ecosystem of water security.
Complementing the JJM, the government has significantly expanded its water conservation and management framework through the "Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain" (JSA:CTR) 2024 campaign, launched with the theme "Nari Shakti se Jal Shakti" (women's power for water security). This comprehensive campaign has achieved remarkable results, with 8,80,269 water conservation and rainwater harvesting structures created or ongoing, 2,16,134 traditional water bodies renovated, and 6,19,68,567 afforestation activities carried out, while establishing 702 Jal Shakti Kendras and preparing 617 district water conservation plans across the country JJM Dashboard. The policy's innovation lies in its "Jal Sanchay Jan Bhagidari" initiative, which represents a groundbreaking approach to water management by leveraging corporate social responsibility funds and community participation to construct millions of recharge structures. This collaborative effort aims to construct a million recharge structures including check dams, percolation tanks and recharge wells, supported by CSR funds from industrial houses, civic bodies and water sector enthusiasts, with data for 4.00 lakh structures already uploaded to the dedicated monitoring portal JJM Dashboard. These recent policy developments demonstrate India's evolution toward integrated, technology-enabled water governance that combines infrastructure development with community participation, environmental sustainability, and innovative financing mechanisms, setting a global precedent for comprehensive water security strategies.
