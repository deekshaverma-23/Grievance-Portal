In Uttar Pradesh, the government has implemented a major expansion of early childhood education under the framework of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 by establishing over 70,000 Balvatikas (play-based early learning centers) in government primary and composite schools. These Balvatikas, targeting children aged 3 to 6, emphasize vibrant, child-centered environments—featuring colorful classrooms, learning corners, outdoor play equipment, and “wonder boxes.” Guided by trained Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) educators, these spaces support a seamless and joyful transition into Class 1, nurturing creativity, social skills, and confidence in young learners. This initiative marks a significant leap forward in advancing foundational education across the state, setting new standards for early learning infrastructure.

In Delhi, a recent survey by the Directorate of Education exposed critical gaps in essential infrastructure across government schools. Among 799 schools assessed, over 100 faced unreliable or no water supply—some entirely dependent on tankers, while others lacked supply altogether. On the electricity front, six schools had no grid connection, and 33 reported irregular power, significantly disrupting classroom operations. In response, the DoE has issued formal directives requiring urgent remedies—expediting water connections, establishing dedicated supply lines, testing groundwater, resolving power supply issues in coordination with discoms, and exploring solar panel installations. Schools must submit compliance reports within 15 days, demonstrating the government’s resolve to ensure uninterrupted access to these fundamental utilities in educational institutions.
