Major Pollution Control Resolutions

1. Phasing Out Older Diesel Trucks & Converting Buses to CNG (Delhi-NCR)
The central government has announced a sweeping move to tackle traffic pollution by phasing out approximately 200,000 non–BS-VI-compliant trucks in the Delhi-NCR region. Simultaneously, around 20,000 diesel government and private buses will be converted to CNG within the next five years—boosting cleaner urban mobility and aligning with air quality targets.

2. Forced Closure of Illegal Bleaching Units on Yamuna
The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has flagged 32 illegal bleaching units operating without environmental clearances near Panipat, discharging untreated wastewater into the Yamuna. Of these, 30 units received formal closure notices following a High-Risk ('Red') categorization; action remains pending against the remaining two.

3. Standardization of Environmental Compensation for Construction Pollution
The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has implemented a new Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for calculating and enforcing environmental compensation for violations at construction and demolition (C&D) sites. The SOP mandates evidence-based documentation such as geo-tagged photos and inspection logs, to be verified within three days. Additionally, DPCC will deploy IT tools and forensic audits to enhance accountability across Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh.

4. NGT Orders IIT Delhi to Evaluate UV Disinfection in Sewage Treatment
Responding to discrepancies in sewage treatment efficacy, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directed IIT Delhi to assess ultraviolet (UV) disinfection technology for treating fecal coliform in sewage. This order complemented a directive for the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to take remedial and punitive action against 14 non-compliant sewage treatment plants (STPs), with the next hearing slated for November 11, 2025.

5. Revoked SO₂ Emission Mandate for Most Coal Power Plants
In a controversial move, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) issued a revised notification easing sulphur dioxide (SO₂) emission norms for coal- and lignite-based thermal power plants (TPPs). Under the changed regulation, roughly 79% of TPPs (located more than 10 km from densely populated areas) are exempt from mandatory Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) systems. Only around 10% near large urban centers must install FGDs by December 2027. Experts warn that this could negatively affect air quality in industrial regions such as Jharkhand.

6. Underutilization of Central Pollution Control Funds
A parliamentary panel expressed alarm that the Environment Ministry spent less than 1% of the ₹858 crore allocated to the ‘Control of Pollution’ scheme in FY 2024–25—only ₹7.22 crore was used by January 2025. The delay was attributed to approvals pending for continuing the scheme, prompting a recommendation for immediate introspection and operational reform.

7. Delhi’s Comprehensive “Air Pollution Mitigation Plan 2025”
Delhi launched a robust 25-point blueprint titled “Shuddh Hawa Sabka Adhikar – Pradushan Par Zordar Prahar”, targeting dust, vehicle emissions, C&D waste, industrial pollutants, solid waste, urban greening, and real-time monitoring. Key measures include:

Deployment of over 5,000 electric buses and 2,299 e-autos

Installation of mist sprayers and anti-smog guns

Bi-annual PUC audits

Enforcing only BS-VI, CNG, or electric vehicles from November 1, 2025

Mandatory C&D registration and recycled construction materials
