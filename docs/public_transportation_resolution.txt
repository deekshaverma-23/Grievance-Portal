Public Transportation Complaint Resolution Case Study: Delayed DTC Bus Services on Route 764
Initial Complaint (Filed: January 22, 2025)
Ms. Anjali Gupta, a software engineer commuting daily from Dwarka Sector 21 to Connaught Place, filed a complaint through the Delhi Transport Corporation's (DTC) online portal and One Delhi app (Complaint ID: DTC-2025-764-2341) regarding chronic delays and overcrowding on bus route 764. The complaint detailed that buses on this crucial route, serving over 2,000 daily passengers, were running 45-60 minutes behind schedule during peak hours, forcing commuters to take expensive private transportation or arrive late to work. Ms. Gupta reported that only 3 out of the scheduled 8 buses were operational during morning peak hours (7:30-9:30 AM), leading to severe overcrowding with passengers hanging from doors and creating safety hazards, particularly for women and elderly commuters. The complaint included time-stamped photographs showing overcrowded buses, GPS tracking data from her phone showing actual versus scheduled arrival times, and a petition signed by 127 regular commuters demanding immediate service improvements.
Operational Assessment and Root Cause Analysis (January 23-24, 2025)
DTC's Deputy General Manager (Operations) Rajesh Khanna immediately deployed a monitoring team led by Regional Transport Officer Sunita Sharma to conduct comprehensive route analysis. The investigation revealed multiple systemic issues: 5 out of 12 assigned buses were undergoing extended maintenance due to engine problems and lack of spare parts, inadequate driver deployment with 3 drivers on extended medical leave and 2 positions vacant, and traffic congestion at three critical chokepoints (Dwarka Mor, Najafgarh Road, and Patel Chowk) adding 15-20 minutes to each trip. The technical assessment also discovered that the route's bus scheduling had not been updated since 2019 despite significant changes in traffic patterns and passenger demand, while the aging fleet (average age 8 years) was experiencing frequent breakdowns requiring emergency repairs that disrupted service continuity.
Immediate Service Enhancement and Resource Deployment (January 25-29, 2025)
DTC implemented emergency measures including immediate deployment of 4 spare buses from neighboring routes to restore full fleet capacity, assignment of additional drivers through overtime deployment and inter-depot transfers, and coordination with Delhi Traffic Police to optimize signal timing at identified bottlenecks. The corporation fast-tracked maintenance of the 5 broken-down buses by engaging authorized workshops on priority basis and arranging emergency procurement of critical spare parts. Additionally, DTC activated its bus tracking system to provide real-time location updates through the One Delhi app and deployed supervisory staff at major stops to manage passenger flow and ensure safety protocols. Route optimization was implemented by introducing express services during peak hours with limited stops, reducing journey time by 25% and improving schedule adherence.
Technology Integration and Service Monitoring (January 30 - February 5, 2025)
DTC enhanced the route's technological infrastructure by installing GPS tracking devices on all buses, enabling real-time monitoring through the central control room and passenger information systems at major bus stops. The corporation deployed its recently launched "DTC Sahayak" mobile app feature allowing passengers to track bus locations, report issues instantly, and receive service updates via SMS. Quality improvement measures included assignment of dedicated route supervisors, implementation of passenger feedback kiosks at terminal points, and introduction of women safety marshals during peak hours. The service quality was continuously monitored through automated passenger counting systems and customer satisfaction surveys conducted by third-party agencies to ensure objective assessment of improvements.
Performance Validation and Continuous Improvement (February 6-20, 2025)
Following implementation of comprehensive solutions, DTC established rigorous monitoring protocols including daily operational reviews, weekly passenger satisfaction surveys, and monthly route performance analysis. Ms. Gupta received follow-up calls on February 1 and February 10, 2025, from Assistant General Manager (Customer Relations) Priya Singh, confirming service improvements and gathering additional feedback. The complaint was officially closed on February 20, 2025, after four weeks of consistent improved performance showing 95% schedule adherence, reduced passenger waiting time from 25 minutes to 8 minutes during peak hours, and passenger satisfaction scores improving from 2.3/5.0 to 4.2/5.0. Post-resolution analysis demonstrated a 40% increase in ridership on the route and elimination of safety incidents related to overcrowding.
Systemic Transformation and Policy Impact:
This successful resolution catalyzed broader improvements in DTC's operational framework: implementation of predictive maintenance systems using IoT sensors to prevent breakdowns, establishment of rapid response teams for route disruptions with 2-hour resolution targets, and creation of a centralized passenger grievance management system with automated escalation protocols. The case influenced Delhi government's "Smart Public Transport Policy 2025," mandating real-time tracking for all bus routes, dynamic route optimization based on demand patterns, and integration of electric buses under the PM e-Bus Sewa scheme for enhanced service reliability. DTC also strengthened its human resource management by establishing driver training academies, implementing performance incentives, and creating career advancement pathways to address staffing challenges. The resolution methodology was adopted as a standard operating procedure across all DTC routes, demonstrating how systematic problem-solving combining operational efficiency, technology integration, and passenger-centric service delivery can transform urban public transportation while supporting India's broader sustainable mobility objectives.
