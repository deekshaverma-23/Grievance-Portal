Resolution on Pollution Control in India (2025)

Recognizing the urgent need to combat rising levels of air, water, and industrial pollution across the country, the Government of India and state authorities have undertaken a series of coordinated measures to safeguard public health, environment, and sustainable development.

The resolution focuses on multiple dimensions:

Vehicular Emissions – Approximately 2 lakh non-BS-VI trucks in the Delhi-NCR region are to be phased out, while 20,000 diesel buses will be converted to CNG within five years. Further, electric mobility is being promoted with the introduction of over 5,000 electric buses and expansion of e-autos.

Industrial and Construction Pollution – Closure of illegal bleaching units discharging untreated wastewater into the Yamuna has been mandated. A standardized framework for environmental compensation in construction and demolition activities has been introduced by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee to strengthen accountability.

Sewage Treatment – Non-compliant sewage treatment plants have been flagged, and IIT Delhi has been tasked to evaluate ultraviolet (UV) disinfection technology to ensure effective reduction of fecal contamination before release into water bodies.

Thermal Power Plant Emissions – Revised emission guidelines exempt 79% of coal-based power plants from installing Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) units, while plants closer to urban centers must comply by 2027. This decision balances industrial feasibility with environmental obligations, though stricter monitoring has been recommended.

Urban Air Quality Management – Delhi has launched a comprehensive 25-point action plan, “Shuddh Hawa Sabka Adhikar – Pradushan Par Zordar Prahar”, addressing vehicular emissions, construction dust, waste burning, industrial pollutants, and greening. Measures include mandatory use of BS-VI/CNG/electric vehicles, PUC audits, mist sprayers, anti-smog guns, and plantation of 70 lakh trees.

Financial Accountability – Parliamentary committees have urged better utilization of allocated funds, highlighting that less than 1% of the ₹858 crore earmarked for pollution control was used in FY 2024–25, and recommending stricter fund deployment for effective implementation.

Therefore, it is resolved that the Government of India, in coordination with state governments, shall:

Accelerate adoption of clean mobility solutions,

Enforce strict industrial compliance with pollution norms,

Modernize sewage and waste treatment systems,

Mandate accountability in construction and demolition activities,

Monitor power sector emissions under revised guidelines, and

Ensure optimal use of financial resources for pollution abatement.

This resolution reflects India’s commitment to protecting public health and the environment while advancing sustainable economic growth.
