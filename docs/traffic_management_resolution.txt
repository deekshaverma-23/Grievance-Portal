Resolution on Traffic Management in India

The Government of India, in collaboration with state authorities and urban development bodies, has recognized the urgent need to address rising traffic congestion, road safety concerns, and inefficiencies in urban mobility. Recent steps reflect a comprehensive resolution to strengthen traffic management through infrastructure, technology, and administrative reforms.

One of the key resolutions has been the adoption of advanced technologies such as the Multi-Lane Free Flow (MLFF) tolling system and AI-enabled Intelligent Traffic Management Systems (ITMS) in major cities like Delhi and highways such as the Dwarka Expressway. These systems ensure seamless toll collection, real-time detection of traffic violations, and better coordination of traffic flows. Additionally, infrastructure projects like new flyovers, elevated corridors, and signal-free zones in Delhi, Gurgaon, Kolkata, and other metropolitan areas are being prioritized to eliminate choke points and reduce travel time.

At the administrative and legal level, courts and local governments have resolved to improve traffic flow by mandating manual management during peak hours, revising public transport schedules, and implementing stricter road safety enforcement. States such as Uttar Pradesh have passed resolutions to invest heavily in bypasses, ring roads, and underpasses to decongest urban cores.

In essence, the resolution on traffic management in India emphasizes a three-fold approach:

Infrastructure expansion to improve road capacity.

Digital transformation using AI-powered monitoring and tolling.

Administrative reforms to enforce discipline and optimize mobility.

This multi-layered approach is expected to enhance road safety, reduce travel delays, cut fuel wastage, and create a more sustainable traffic ecosystem for the future.
