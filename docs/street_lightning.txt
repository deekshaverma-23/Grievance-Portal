One of the most significant recent developments in Indian street lighting policy is the **Municipal Corporation of Delhi's ambitious LED street lighting modernization project**, announced in October 2024, which represents the largest urban street lighting transformation initiative in India's recent history. On October 27, 2024, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) proposed an INR 1,144.3 Crore (USD 137.3 Million) project to replace approximately 400,000 LED lights across Central, South, West, and Najafgarh zones, with the plan including a 10-year contract for installation, operation, and maintenance. This massive undertaking builds upon the foundation laid by India's successful Street Lighting National Programme (SLNP), which launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 5, 2015, became the world's largest streetlight replacement programme, implemented by Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL). The Delhi project represents a paradigm shift from the earlier national program by incorporating comprehensive lifecycle management, including not just installation but also long-term maintenance and operational efficiency optimization across one of India's most populous urban centers.

The policy framework underlying this initiative reflects a sophisticated understanding of urban infrastructure needs, combining energy efficiency with public safety imperatives and technological advancement. The Delhi Government's approach was informed by comprehensive research, including the Women's Safety Audit conducted by NGO Safetipin, which found that street lighting has the maximum impact on the perception of safety, leading the government to identify 2000 dark spots and undertake systematic illumination projects. This evidence-based policymaking approach demonstrates how modern street lighting policy has evolved beyond mere illumination to encompass crime prevention, gender safety, traffic management, and environmental sustainability. The substantial investment of over INR 1,144 crore also reflects the government's recognition that quality urban infrastructure requires sustained financial commitment and professional management systems. The 10-year operational contract model ensures accountability and performance standards while relieving municipal authorities of day-to-day maintenance burdens, representing a shift toward service-oriented governance in public infrastructure. This policy innovation, covering approximately 400,000 LED installations, positions Delhi as a model for other major Indian cities grappling with aging street lighting infrastructure, inadequate coverage, and the dual challenges of energy efficiency and public safety in rapidly urbanizing environments.
