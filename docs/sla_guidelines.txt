Service Level Agreement (SLA) standards are defined by government Public Grievance guidelines:
- Critical issues (threat to life, fire, hospital ICU failure) must be responded to within 4 hours.
- High severity issues (prolonged disruption of essential services) should be resolved within 12–24 hours.
- Medium severity issues (inconveniences affecting quality of life) are resolved within 24–72 hours.
- Low severity issues (cosmetic or minor problems) are resolved within 72 hours to one week depending on department norms.
Actual SLA may vary by department but must adhere to principles of timely service delivery under Citizen’s Charters.
