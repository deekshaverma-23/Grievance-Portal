1. National Free Flow and AI-Enhanced Tolling

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has debuted India’s first Multi-Lane Free Flow (MLFF) tolling system in Gujarat, offering seamless toll collection without stopping at booths. This technology significantly cuts congestion at toll points. A similar initiative is set to roll out soon in Haryana, including at Gharaunda on the Delhi–Chandigarh highway and Choryasi toll plaza on NH-48.

2. Highway Infrastructure Expansion

A landmark infrastructure push includes four new six-lane flyovers between Kherki Daula and Jaisinghpur Khera on the NH-8 corridor (Gurgaon–Jaipur stretch), funded at ₹282 crore. Scheduled for completion by 2027, the developments will also feature service roads, pedestrian bridges, better drainage, rainwater harvesting, and enhanced lighting and signage for improved road safety and environment.

Simultaneously, Delhi will benefit from the ambitious "Super Six" decongestion plan: six major road projects covering 128 km in and around the capital, backed by ₹23,850 crore in funding to improve connectivity and reduce congestion.

3. AI-Powered Traffic Enforcement and Smart Systems

On the Dwarka Expressway, NHAI’s latest Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS) uses AI to detect 14 types of traffic violations in real time, helping monitor a digitally managed corridor of over 56 km.

In Delhi, the government has initiated tenders for an Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) featuring AI-enabled ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) across 500 critical junctions. This system will automatically detect a wide array of violations—speeding, red-light breaches, mobile phone use while driving, seat-belt and helmet non-compliance, overloaded vehicles, lane indiscipline, and even fake number plates. Data will feed into centralized dashboards to support both operational traffic control and long-term urban planning.

4. Legal and Administrative Directives

In Kochi, the Kerala High Court issued a judicial directive to switch off traffic signals during peak hours, mandating manual traffic management with walkie-talkie coordination. The aim is to reduce gridlock where signal timings proved inefficient. The court also fast-tracked rescheduling private bus timings to alleviate congestion.

5. Urban Traffic Relief in Kolkata

The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) is moving ahead with the expansion of Dhalai Bridge near Patuli ahead of Durga Puja. The bridge widening—adding a 21.5 m steel-composite span—will provide smoother north-south traffic flow, improving travel time by approximately 20 seconds per signal cycle at adjacent crossings.

6. State-Level Road Network Expansion

In Uttar Pradesh, the state government has approved a ₹6,124 crore infrastructure investment for the 2025–26 period. Sixty-two targeted projects—ring roads, bypasses, flyovers, and underpasses—will integrate national highways and state roads across cities like Lucknow, Kanpur, Agra, Varanasi, and more, aimed at reducing travel time and strengthening traffic management
