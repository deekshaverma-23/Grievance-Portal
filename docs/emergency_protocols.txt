Emergency response protocols for government services involve multi-agency coordination.
Critical scenarios such as fire, explosion, hospital emergencies, gas leaks, structural failures must trigger:
- Immediate notification of Police, Fire Brigade, Medical Emergency Services.
- Deployment of responders within statutory timelines.
- Coordination between departments is mandated under the Disaster Management Act and National Emergency Response Guidelines.
Such events are top priority under SLA standards and require real-time escalation and follow-up.
