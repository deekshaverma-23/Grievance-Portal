Easing Coal Supply Through Revised SHAKTI Policy

In May 2025, the Union Cabinet approved substantial revisions to the SHAKTI (Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyala Transparently in India) policy to ensure a reliable electricity supply amid rising demand. Under the updated policy, central, state, and independent power producers (IPPs) can now secure coal supplies via two flexible mechanisms:

Window I continues the traditional model—granting linkages to central and state thermal power units at notified prices.

Window II innovates by allowing all coal-based producers (including those importing coal) to obtain linkages through auctions, for durations ranging from 12 months up to 25 years, by paying a premium over the base price.

This strategic change aims to boost fuel security, particularly for new thermal projects, reduce transportation burdens by encouraging plants near coal pitheads, and ultimately help lower electricity tariffs for consumers

Infrastructure Modernization Through RDSS and Budget Boosts

The government's 2025–26 Union Budget further emphasizes power sector reform. Notable enhancements include:

Allocating ₹3037.58 billion to the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS), which supports performance-based funding, infrastructure upgrades like prepaid smart meters, and targets the reduction of Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses to 12–15%, alongside bridging revenue gaps

Significant funding for the Nuclear Energy Mission (₹200 billion), aiming to install 100 GW of nuclear capacity by 2047 and operationalize at least five small modular reactors (SMRs) by 2033. Legislative amendments to relevant nuclear liability and atomic energy laws are underway to facilitate these plans

Technological Advancements for Renewable Integration

To support the rapid expansion of renewable energy, the government is sharpening its weather forecasting capabilities for better grid management:

The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) is upgrading from broad-scale to highly granular forecasting—capable of resolving cloud movements and weather shifts at district or local levels in sync with power grid cycles (as frequent as 15 minutes).

The goal: improve planning, enhance grid stability, and enable efficient integration of solar, wind, hydro, and other renewables. CEA is also shifting from a five-year to an annual energy planning cycle

Additionally, there are continued incentives for clean energy:

Waivers of Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) charges have been extended to projects commissioned up to 30 June 2025, covering solar, wind, pumped hydro (PSP), and battery energy storage systems (BESS). This encourages interstate transmission of renewable energy while bolstering infrastructure readiness

Summary: What These Policies Achieve

The Indian government’s recent efforts aim to:

Secure fuel supply for thermal plants through flexible coal allocation mechanisms.

Modernize distribution networks and improve financial and operational health of DISCOMs via RDSS.

Boost renewable & nuclear energy capacity with targeted budget spikes and regulatory facilitation.

Enhance grid resilience by upgrading forecasting tools and transmission planning.

Promote clean energy adoption with cost incentives and demand-led policies.

Together, these policies reflect a holistic strategy—balancing immediate power demand concerns with long-term sustainability and energy transition goals.
