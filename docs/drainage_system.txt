One of the most significant recent developments in India's drainage and sewage system policy is the **Draft Liquid Waste Management (LWM) Rules 2024**, notified by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change on October 7, 2024, which represents a comprehensive overhaul of India's wastewater treatment and reuse framework. The rules mandate enforcement starting from October 2025, giving stakeholders a transition period of one year to comply, with initial reuse targets for bulk water consumers—industries, institutions and large housing societies—set at 20 percent for the 2027-28 period, rising to 50 percent by 2030-31. This policy framework addresses India's mounting sewage crisis through a structured approach that prioritizes collection, treatment, reuse, and disposal of both wastewater and associated sludge, grounded in the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The rules introduce the innovative **Extended User Responsibility (EUR) framework**, which mandates that bulk water users must ensure proper treatment and reuse of their wastewater, shifting responsibility from solely government-managed systems to shared accountability between public authorities and major water consumers.

The 2024 LWM Rules represent a paradigm shift toward decentralized sewage management and circular economy principles, addressing the limitations of India's current infrastructure where traditional centralized treatment plants struggle with growing wastewater volumes. The notification incorporates detailed guidelines for managing sewage sludge (or septage), aligned with circular economy principles where waste is converted into a resource, addressing India's production of approximately eight million tonnes of sewage sludge annually. However, the policy faces significant implementation challenges due to conflicting targets across various national missions, including Swachh Bharat Mission 2.0 mandating 20 percent wastewater reuse for cities under 100,000 population, AMRUT 2.0 aiming for 20 percent of total water demand recycling, and the National Mission for Clean Ganga framework setting higher targets of 50 percent reuse by 2025 and 100 percent by 2050 where STPs are operational. The rules establish a rigorous compliance framework requiring operators of both centralized and decentralized treatment plants to report monthly data on treatment volumes, sludge management, and reuse outcomes to State Pollution Control Boards through a centralized online portal. Despite the ambitious vision, successful implementation depends heavily on addressing capacity constraints of pollution control boards, providing financial and technical support to smaller municipalities and rural areas, overcoming public resistance to treated wastewater reuse, and establishing standardized targets across competing national frameworks to create a coherent and achievable pathway toward sustainable sewage management in India's rapidly urbanizing landscape.
