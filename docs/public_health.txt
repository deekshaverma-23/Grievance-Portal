In Haryana, the government is set to launch an 11-week “Safai Marathon” in Gurgaon, commencing on September 7 and concluding on November 7, 2025. The Haryana Shahri Swachhta Abhiyan will mobilize citizens, NGOs, students, and officials to clean homes, streets, markets, and public spaces, reinforced by a collective pledge—"Swachhta Meri Zimmedari"—emphasizing personal responsibility in sanitation. This campaign highlights the power of civic engagement and interdepartmental coordination in tackling waste management challenges.

Meanwhile, Kerala has rolled out a pioneering initiative—in-house sanitation training for medical college hospital staff. Spearheaded by Health Minister Veena George, this infection-control protocol mandates certification for managing biomedical waste safely at its source. This move complements infrastructure upgrades, including new medical and nursing colleges, expanded capacity, safety audits, and facility improvements, all aimed at bolstering hospital sanitation standards.

In Delhi, the “Delhi’s Freedom from Garbage” campaign has been extended through October 2, in response to a high-level review. The government is pressing forward with aggressive waste management strategies, including flattening major landfills (Ghazipur, Okhla, Bhalswa), boosting the capacity of existing waste-to-energy (WTE) plants, and launching five new or upgraded WTE facilities. Supported by a ₹50 crore viability gap fund for Okhla’s expansion, the plan includes decentralized waste centres and innovative sustainable practices such as cow-dung–based cremation logs and gobar (biogas) plants. By aiming to eliminate fresh waste dumping by 2026, this strategy underscores Delhi’s commitment to closing the loop on waste.

Back in Kerala, authorities responded to growing concerns over sanitary waste—such as pads and diapers—by announcing a new processing plant capable of handling an additional 120 tonnes per day. Supplemented by four regional plants, this facility targets the daily 100 tonnes of sanitary waste, while plans to convert up to 720 tonnes of non-recyclable reject waste into refuse-derived fuel (RDF) are already underway. This expansion is part of a workshop-led push for enhanced health sector waste management.

Finally, Delhi's healthcare system received a regulatory boost: a one-time age relaxation of up to 10 years for appointing doctors, pharmacists, and multipurpose health workers in Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAMs). Medical officers up to 55 years old are now eligible (versus previous caps of 45 for doctors, 30 for others), with recruitment slated to begin in September. This adjustment aims to fill critical staffing gaps ahead of the end of central funding under the PM-Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission in March 2026, ensuring that nearly 1,139 centers can become operational swiftly.
