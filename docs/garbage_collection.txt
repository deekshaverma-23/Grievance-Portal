The most significant recent development in Indian waste management policy is the Draft Solid Waste Management Rules 2024, released by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) in December 2024, which represents a comprehensive overhaul of India's waste management framework. These rules amend and expand upon the Solid Waste Management Rules of 2016, and are set to come into force on October 1, 2025, providing a transition period for stakeholders Jal Jeevan Mission. The new policy addresses India's mounting waste crisis, where the country generates 62+ million tons of waste annually, of which only 43 million tons are collected and merely 12 million tons are properly treated, with the remaining 31 million tons dumped in wasteyards Jal Jeevan Mission. The government has incorporated key recommendations from the Centre for Science and Environment, focusing on circular economy principles and improved waste utilisation Jal Jeevan Mission: Ensuring Tap Water for 15 Crore Rural ..., marking a paradigm shift from traditional disposal-oriented approaches to resource recovery and sustainability-focused waste management.
The 2024 rules introduce several groundbreaking concepts that fundamentally reshape waste management responsibilities and accountability. Similar to extended producer responsibility (EPR), the rules have introduced the Extended Bulk Waste Generator Responsibility (EBWGR) which proposes new obligations for entities who generate large quantities of solid waste, along with provisions for mandatory segregation at source Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation: Home. This policy innovation recognizes that effective waste management begins at the point of generation and extends responsibility beyond traditional municipal boundaries to include large-scale waste generators such as commercial establishments, institutions, and industries. The rules emphasize technological modernization and scientific waste management practices, addressing longstanding challenges including poor collection systems especially in rural areas, limited waste separation at source, shortage of trained workers, and low public awareness about proper disposal Jal Jeevan Mission. The policy framework also tackles the complex jurisdictional challenges that have historically hampered effective waste management, where multiple agencies share oversight responsibilities with MoEFCC developing rules and guidelines while the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs oversees ground-level enforcement Jal Jeevan Mission. The draft rules are currently open for public comment until the first week of February 2025, with feedback being incorporated as MoEFCC finalizes the policy, demonstrating the government's commitment to stakeholder consultation and evidence-based policymaking in addressing India's escalating waste management challenges Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM)
