Based on the comprehensive Year End Review 2024 from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, one of the most significant recent developments in Indian government road maintenance policy is the Performance-Based Maintenance Contract (PBMC) and Short-Term Maintenance Contract (STMC) framework, which represents a fundamental shift toward systematic, accountable road maintenance across India's extensive National Highway network. The Ministry has evolved a mechanism to ensure maintenance and repair of all National Highway sections through accountable maintenance agencies, with an average annual expenditure of Rs. 6,000 crore incurred on maintenance and repair during the last three years Jal Jeevan Mission: Ensuring Tap Water for 15 Crore Rural Families. This policy innovation addresses the critical challenge of maintaining India's rapidly expanding highway infrastructure, which has grown from 91,287 km in 2014 to 146,195 km currently. Out of the total 146,195 km length of National Highway network, about 38,842 km length is under development, 55,448 km length under Defect Liability Period/Concession Period, and 29,030 km length under maintenance, with the Ministry planning to take up maintenance in about 25,000 km length through STMC/PBMC mode during the current financial year 2024-25, of which works in about 19,000 km length have already been approved Jal Jeevan Mission: Ensuring Tap Water for 15 Crore Rural Families.
The maintenance policy framework demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of lifecycle infrastructure management by categorizing road maintenance responsibilities across different contractual arrangements. For stretches where development works have commenced or Operation, Maintenance and Transfer (OMT) Concessions/Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Contracts have been awarded, the responsibility lies with concerned Concessionaires/Contractors till the end of the Defect Liability Period or Concession Period, while for National Highway stretches under TOT (Toll Operate and Transfer) and InvIT (Infrastructure Investment Trust), maintenance responsibility lies with concerned Concessionaire till the end of the Concession Period Jal Jeevan Mission: Ensuring Tap Water for 15 Crore Rural Families. This comprehensive approach is complemented by substantial investment in digital infrastructure, including the BhoomiRashi Portal for land acquisition, which has facilitated the acquisition of around 1,47,320.11 hectares of land through transparent, digitized processes since 2018. The policy also emphasizes proactive safety measures through systematic blackspot identification and rectification, with 13,795 black spots identified on National Highways, of which short-term rectification measures have been completed on 9,525 black spots and permanent rectification completed on 4,777 black spots Jal Jeevan Mission: Ensuring Tap Water for 15 Crore Rural Families. This integrated approach to maintenance, combining performance-based contracting, digital governance, and preventive safety measures, represents a significant evolution in India's road infrastructure management, ensuring both the sustainability of massive capital investments and the safety of millions of highway users across the country.
