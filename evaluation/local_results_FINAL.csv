Illegal shops are occupying the footpath blocking pedestrians.,"['Roads & Infrastructure SOP:\nCritical roadway hazards (sinkholes, major potholes) require barricading and repair planning within 6 hours.\nTemporary fixes must be deployed before full repair.\nSignage issues are medium priority and should be corrected within 48 hours.\nConstruction abandonment reports should trigger contractor notification and penalty evaluation.\nTraffic diversion plans must be shared for extended repairs.']"," In this context, since illegal shops are obstructing pedestrian walkways, which is not explicitly mentioned as a roadway hazard but rather an obstruction on the footpath, it may be considered as a signage issue or obstruction that impacts pedestrians' safety and mobility.

However, given the severity of the obstruction, it would be advisable to prioritize this issue similarly to critical roadway hazards (sinkholes, major potholes). Therefore, barricading should be implemented as soon as possible, and a plan for the removal or relocation of these shops should be initiated within 6 hours.

Additionally, it would be essential to ensure that pedestrians are aware of any potential hazards or diversions due to the removal process, so appropriate signage should be installed, correcting the signage issues within a reasonable time frame (preferably within 48 hours).

Lastly, it may also be worth considering documenting such instances as construction abandonment reports to trigger contractor notification and penalty evaluation, especially if these shops have been illegally occupying the footpath for an extended period.",Law and Order enforcement inspection and removal.,0.625,0.9999999999,,0.7633470026165331
